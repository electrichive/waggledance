# Learning Resources

This page is separate from the [learning guide](./). The following is a collection of various resources that may be useful to the learning programmer.

## General Resources

* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)
* [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses)
* [Udemy](https://udemy.com/)
  * <a id="udemy-warning">**Warning about Udemy course pricing!**</a> Please read this important purchasing note: Any Udemy course you buy should cost approximately $10 - $15 as an out-the-door/final price, depending on the "sale" they are currently offering, and you should absolutely not pay more than $15 for any one course. If the course is not “on sale”, do one of the following:
    * Search online for a coupon for the course.
    * Open an incognito tab on your browser and check if the Udemy course is listed at an appropriate price in that tab.
    * Look to see if the specific course is offered on another platform for an appropriate price.
    * Wait until the course is "on sale".
  * About Udemy's shady marketing tactics: The list price of any Udemy course is typically shown as ~$50 - $200, but Udemy runs "sales" (in other words, selling the course at the actual, reasonable price) for most courses that are available the vast majority of the time. This is an attempt to pressure potential customers into purchasing courses through the use of such tricks as displaying a text block that describes the course price as "XX% off" (see [this article about deceptive "original prices"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-stores-fool-us-by-listing-the-original-price-during-sales-180947811/) and [this article about deceptive pricing](https://www.consumerwatchdog.org/news-story/deceptive-pricing-unlawful-trickery-or-skillful-selling)) along with text that says "N hours left at this price!" (see [this article about the illusion of scarcity](https://hbr.org/2007/08/how-to-profit-from-scarcity-1)). For more information on Udemy's unscrupulous marketing tactics, please see:
    * [Read This Before You Buy Any Udemy Course](https://www.labnol.org/internet/buying-udemy-courses/31851/) and the [associated Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17196183)
    * [Reddit: Reminder for people buying courses on sites like Udemy](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7uu98h/reminder_for_people_buying_courses_on_sites_like/)
    * [Quora: Why do Udemy prices keep changing drastically](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Udemy-prices-keep-changing-drastically)
  * Udemy employees, if you're reading this, please stop using these crooked marketing and pricing tactics and just set the list price to be the reasonable price. Your marketing and pricing tactics are dodgy at best and unethical at worst, and it's a shame that your own tactics make your business look bad.
